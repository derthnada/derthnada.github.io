## Let's Get Started!

I wanted to lay out a few notes about the approach I intend to take with my first-ever **#SoloAModule** event, and enumerate some presuppositions that may provide some context to this whole mess. 

## Presupposition #0

 Almost everything I do on this blog is intended for myself as much--and sometimes more--than it is for an audience. It falls somewhere between a blog, a journal, a play table, and a messy pile of scrap paper and post-it notes. Keep your editorial expectations low, I guess is kinda what I'm saying.

## What I Want to Explore, in a Nutshell

I am interested in experiencing a classic, old-school module through the lens of a modern, story-first system...and then see what dousing the whole thing with oracles and other solo tools will do to it. My money is on violent conflagration! 

## The Tools I'm Gonna Use (Probably)

Like many solo roleplayers, I have wrestled with the best way to go about capturing a record of play as it happens. I've never been concerned about sharing any of it until now, so brief, cryptic scribblings on paper have so far been sufficient to jog my memory, keep my place in the story, and relive past adventures. 

But since I want to _participate_ in this event and share my experiences with this wonderful emerging community, I think a more long-form approach is called for. That pretty much rules out writing, since I'm slow and sloppy when it comes to penmanship (and most other things, really). Actually...it rules out a lot of options, but raises a bunch of others. Hrm.Â Ok, maybe I'll write about some of them later, but long story short: 

**I'm going to use this blog as my actual, real-time recording device _as well_ as my publication mechanism.** 

I'm pretty quick with the typing, and markdown is a fabulous way to quickly differentiate types of text, such as the narration, game mechanics, dialog, etc. Like, look how I set this next section off with one li'l character:

> Specifically, I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a bunch of markdown extensions. I have a live preview going, and I can define little template snippets that can generate boilerplate stuff (like stat blocks) in a few keystrokes. But most importantly, I can split the editing window and have multiple files open at once. Since this is also my playspace, that will be incredibly useful when it comes to keeping track of my characters, plot threads, NPCs, and scenes. 

## The Rules I'm Gonna Use (Probably)

I've been a long-time fan of Nathan Russell's [Freeform Universal](http://freeformuniversal.com/) rpg, and have been eager to try out some of his new drifts, namely a little fantasy-themed number called _Dungeon Crawlers_. The new hit & trauma mechanics coupled with the...uh...well, the _freeformness_ of FU makes it the ideal candidate for what I'm trying to do, here.

 The one concern I have about this version of the system is that the dice mechanics rely more heavily on the _number_ of dice in the pool than most iterations do. The number of descriptors that provide these dice remains fairly low to start, and I'm preemptively worried about...well, things I probably shouldn't be. Nevertheless, I am going to follow the lead of a FU community member, and bolt on another of Nathan's hacks, [trademarks and meta-tags](http://freeformuniversal.com/introducing-trademarks-meta-tags/). In addition to providing more raw dice, it also allows me to elaborate a bit more on what exactly "druid" or "orphaned street rat" actually mean, and help define a path for advancement right out of the gate.

## The Module I'm Gonna Use (Probably)

I chose the venerable [Keep on the Borderlands](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17158/B2-The-Keep-on-the-Borderlands-Basic). 

**Stop groaning!** I have a reason!

It has been said time and again that, while this module is steeped in nostalgia, it is fairly primitive in design, and provides almost no plot. It's just a bunch of nameless NPCs in keep, and a mishmash of monsters running around some caves, and basically _no plot_. I think one of its biggest criticism has to be that there's practically 

_no_

_plot_.

**BOOM!** Yo, the coolest thing about solo gaming to me is the remarkable way that it capitalizes on our brains' incessant drive to _find patterns_, and uses that to spin out completely original stories on the fly from the barest of inputs. 

(Like, seriously, that shit is still _magical_ to me.)

So here's what I'm gonna do: I'm going to use whatever the module gives me, but liberally apply the tools at my disposal to _inject_ plots. The module is, like, the petri dish, and the solo tools + my imagination are the virulent microorganisms. What could possibly go wrong?

## The Solo Tools I'm Gonna Use (Probably)

FU's resolution mechanic also happens to lend itself perfectly to being an oracle, producing any of these results to any question applied to it:
 * Yes, and
 * Yes
 * Yes, but
 * No, but
 * No
 * No, and

Further, I shall also employ the [GameMaster's Apprentice](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck) deck, chosen for its remarkable versatility and undeniable handiness. When I need more detail or some serious plot inspiration, I like to turn to the somewhat underrated [Covetous Poets Adventure Creator and Solo GM Guidebook](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129909/The-Covetous-Poets-Adventure-Creator-and-Solo-GM-Guidebook). For overall structure, I will most likely employ [Mythic](http://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-game-master-emulator.html)'s lists of NPCs, threads, and scenes. I'm not sure if I'll employ any sort of "chaos factor" thing yet, though. Maybe I'll roll it in later if things get stale or too gonzo.

## Anyway

There you have it!
