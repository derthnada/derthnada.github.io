# Some additional notes right quick

## Calibration

I love rules-lite systems. I love the freedom to let my creativity fly, and make stuff up on the spot, knowing that I can count on the rules to support it all. However, in mulling over how this particular adventure might go, I realized that it would probably be beneficial for me to try and codify some of the elements that would normally be left to impromptu rulings ahead of time. Lighten the workload a little.

### Number Appearing

The module is geared towards 6-9(!) 1st level characters, and I'm going in with 3. They recommend padding the group out with hirelings if the group is short, but I'd much rather keep things intimate, so my first ruling is to simply **halve the number of baddies** in each encounter. It might be more accurate to take it down by 2/3, but the hitpoints (Hits) in Dungeon Crawlers reset after every encounter, so the PCs are going to be a lot more durable than their D&D counterparts.

### HP, Levels & Hit Dice

**Hits: 6 base + 2 per level or HD above 1**. A level 3 fighter: 10 hits. A 1/2 HD kobold: 3.

**Trauma slots:** As a rule of thumb, **mooks get 0 trauma slots, "tough" or "big" versions of normal baddies get 1, leaders get 2, "named" NPCs get 3**. This is a bit tricky, and may be dynamic, since traumas have as much to do with a character's importance to the story as they do survivability. For example, a kobold mook who escapes and returns to exact revenge over and over might get an increasing number of trauma slots as it cements itself as an important character, even though it's not necessarily any tougher in the game world.

### Tags/Descriptors

I think this is going to be the toughest part, since these not only describe the baddies and define their capabilities, but they also directly equate to raw potential effectiveness (number of dice in the pool). For simplicity, it's tempting to just give each species a flat challenge die rating and go with it. On the other hand, the distinction between, say, a kobold's martial prowess (_cough_) and their preternatural knack for setting insidious traps seems like an important distinction to make. Verdict: **wing it, but make it gritty. This is _dangerous business_, so err on the side of liberal tag use**. (I'll probably revise this as I learn.)

### Treasure

**Money: income and expenses in the module, as is.** 

**Magic items: weapon bonuses (e.g. +1 sword) might get a more elaborite descriptor, but that's it. Cooler items, though, get abilities and tags of their own.**
